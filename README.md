## 🌅 Daylight Visualization

The Daylight Visualization feature adds a beautiful 3-pixel high gradient bar to the top of each calendar day, showing the complete daylight cycle for that day.

### Color Coding
- **🌙 Night**: Black/dark colors for nighttime hours
- **🌅 Astronomical Twilight**: Very dark purple (barely visible before sunrise)
- **🌆 Nautical Twilight**: Dark purple (nautical navigation possible)
- **🌇 Civil Twilight**: Medium purple-blue (civil activities possible)
- **🌅 Sunrise**: Red-orange gradient during sunrise
- **✨ Golden Hour**: Golden yellow during morning golden hour
- **☀️ Daylight**: Blue gradient fading from light to rich blue during the day
- **🌇 Evening Golden Hour**: Golden yellow during evening golden hour
- **🌆 Sunset**: Red-orange gradient during sunset
- **🌙 Twilight Phases**: Reverse order of morning twilight

### How It Works
- Each calendar day square shows a horizontal gradient representing 24 hours
- Each pixel column represents 15 minutes (96 total periods per day)
- Sunrise/sunset times are calculated based on your location and season
- Toggle on/off with **Command+L** or through Settings > Feature Flags

### Educational Value
This feature helps users understand:
- Natural daylight cycles and their variation by season
- Sunrise and sunset timing for different days
- The science of twilight phases
- How daylight affects daily activities
